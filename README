The '5620rom' directory is the 5620 rom source tape that was prepared many
years back.  It is mostly untouched.  Documentation is under 5620rom/doc.
See especially the 'Doc' file.  Also see 5620rom/README and 5620rom/README2.

If you have any successes with this package or any modifications you'd like
to see me put in, please send me email.

I was unable to locate a patch directory which was set up to re-generate the
lsys.8;7;3 which patches a 1.1 version ROM into 2.0 functionality, but
theoretically everything you need is here.  If any of you takes the time to
create such a directory, please send it to me so I include it in this package.

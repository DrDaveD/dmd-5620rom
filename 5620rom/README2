WARNING!!

This is a hybred tape and not the official firmware source.
The main reason for this is that firmware was developed under
a different SGS than one supplied on the host tape. The main
difference is that a NOP needed to be added after every
assembler command that explicitly changes the psw register.

Another change was done to this tape to keep the protocol
routines proprietary. This meant splitting some files in half
and supplying only the binary for some of them. Those object
files have been replaced with their source counterpart on
this tape.

For the above reasons, any ROMs made from this tape will
not match those officially released. This will affect only
rom dependent programs. All programs supplied on the host
tape will still work.

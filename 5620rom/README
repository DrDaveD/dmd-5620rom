	      AT&T TELETYPE 5620 DMD FIRMWARE SOURCE TAPE

It is assumed that the firmware source tape is maintained in a seperate
directory hierarchy from the host software. Not doing this can cause
future problems with include files writing over each other.

TO MAKE:
edit the shell setenv in this directory to change DMDCC to locally
	defined path

$ . setenv
$ cp $DMD/lib/comp lib/comp
$ cp $DMD/lib/cpp lib/cpp
$ cp $DMD/lib/optim lib/optim
$ cp $DMD/bin/m32as bin/m32as
$ make.firm

Will expand from around 2200 blocks to almost 7000 blocks. Takes
1/2 hour on an unloaded 3B20S - much longer on loaded machine.

Read the setenv and make.firm shells for important hints.
Look in the directory doc for more information. The files
in src/xt/layersys/roms/save are intel hex files suitable
for burning eproms which will work the same as the ones
released for version 2.0.
